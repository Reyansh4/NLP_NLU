1122987128319823873	@missbethanymae @samycatherine That the main argument, if that is true which has been proven it’s not, is something wrong w| ppl who are autistic?

1313867336932360192	One thing I’ve really started to hate is anytime I mention to anyone that my son has autism they seem to instantly pity me. Like yes we will have our challenges but it’s not like he has a deathly illness. He is a healthy happy boy and that’s all I care about.	1

1471133516754821133	My poor kid. Last night he left his earbuds in the car. He walked back out to get them. We live in the woods so it was pitch dark &amp; a little eerie. And there’s wildlife. Deer will stamp their feet &amp; blow as a warning. But it sounds like a heavy-breathing, asthmatic serial killer.	0
1495146850759892993	The writing was on the wall that this child was abandoned - as soon as I read non-verbal and autistic. Some parents cannot handle it. That baby deserves a household where he can be loved and cared for appropriately - I hope he gets it. https://t.co/ow69t1d7UI	0

1203963615960801280	@Acesmummy My son is 2 and has started one morning a week not to socialise but because of speech delay. It’s helped, he enjoys it, but it’s a hassle and expense. Certainly not something I’d have done if he wasn’t a little behind.	1
1346487491679965185	@lindsay_beeman1 Just so you guys know that kid that did that has non verbal autism and is my brother in law.. but literally your making fun of an autistic child that needs “disciplined” but doesn’t even know that what he was doing was wrong. Obviously you could tell that he wasn’t normal.	0
1434170854317953026	@plscallmeky Yes yes exactly! Our pediatrician thinks our son may be autistic, as he wasn’t really talking much at his most recent check up (he’s 2). I have reached out to people I know with autism for advice and just general know-how and I can’t imagine not having their firsthand knowledge.	0
1122693438179303424	Also when I used to work for pediatricians, pacifiers aren’t good for teeth or speech development. It delays speech and can mess up teeth growth. Same with bottles. Detachment is hard but it’s in the best interest for your child to let go.	0
1328895692522348544	As a kid in public schools during the first 6 years, this was always a huge problem, because this exclusion that I was mostly mandated to join- did nothing but isolate me even more as a disabled Jewish autistic kid.	0
1495426399687094275	I feel like this is another sign of him being possible adhd. The kid hardly ever sits still and when he is playing it’s like every thing is moving around and he doesn’t want to stop to go potty because then he has to sit still and he doesn’t like it.	0
1080636041663397888	@aiahxpebenito I FUCKING HATE when rude ass idiots use Autism as an excuse NOT to vaccinate their child. Uneducated and ignorant as hell, acting like Autism is worse than your child dying of an otherwise eradicated disease. 🤬😤	0

1223065692125171713	@Matthew_MichaeI He could be autistic or something. I’ve seen some kids get pretty violent—it’s like a tantrum a 2 yr old would throw, but b/c they’re older, it looks (and is) a lot scarier. I don’t know how parents of these kids are able to do it day in, day out.	0
1005681061374799872	@track_savage @lily_lovexo @jnudey Either way, you don’t love your kid any less? Doctors have no idea what causes autism. Kids/adults just get it.

You go to enroll your kid in preschool &amp; you’re having to convince the director that he’s a great sweet kid who deserves to be there. Having to explain what he’s like and how he’s a great kid, breaks my heart 🥲	1

1325959837868462081	I have a kid with a speech delay and screen time is shown to increase this dramatically especially before the age of two iirc  Kids also need to also be taught self control for screen time and adults need to be there to moderate that with them.

1264774126964629504	@ProjectQmw @ashrowans @metteharrison Oh for sure! Natalia is just the least predictable autist I know.

1416359139018674176	I do my best not to judge the moms in the disability/autism/speech delay groups I’m in but fuck, you can absolutely tell when someone is wanting to medicate their child so they don’t have to “deal” with them. This same mom also gives her CHILD 10mg of melatonin a night. 10MG!!!!!	0
1384683516504518657	Because at my son’s well check, I “discussed speech delay concerns” (worth noting I made one comment about how my son previously had a delay but I was no longer concerned). Then at my physical, I talked to my doctor for 3 minutes about how I had been having headaches.	1

1230037931399827457	@DaleksGamertag Totally his loss James! If he considers autism a ‘mental illness’ he is obviously very poorly informed and doesn’t deserve you. I teach in a special school, in a class of children who all have autism and let me tell you, as you already know, they are some of the greatest minds!	0

1016787951479611394	@raisingbabyz @BlessedBoyMommy I’d rather my child not have any more seizures and sicknesses caused by vaccines (: autism isn’t even an issue. But ask a heavy autistic person if they would rather have autism or a rash for a week since that’s the argument you (and everyone else) want to you (:	0
1127629938981572609	Lmaoooo I absolutely agree! My daughters learned sooo much from youtube videos and she had a speech delay on top of that. All of my efforts could not get her to speak, until all of a sudden she started singing johnny johnny 🤷🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/yRNF8j3FP3	1

1243844968298491904	@aimliverpool @HeinzUK @ADHDFoundation @LivPaCL8 @Autism @flagupautism Unable to help as live in Kent but I hope they manage to find soon. Often with autism it is sensory issues that cause problems with food. When a child's diet is very limited they may also have ARFID which is usually caused by a food phobia and very little trust in foods good luck	0
1044286807221968897	@_bethalice Precisely! Notice the 30 year jump in time where the ways of diagnosis had vastly improved.. such biased crap!!

1453295807126556673	Anyway, I took Cloud and tiny son to the park and Cloud went and made a fuss over a lad who, I think, had high functioning autism. And he said she was his favourite dog ever and they became firm friends. So, with all due respect to other dogs, my dog is the best dog. https://t.co/QtVeaD9whT	0
1280145091340845058	My son has high functioning autism and that week was the same week I gave birth so I know he was responding to the unknown stresses in his environment. He went to school and fucked their flow all the way up.	1

1083357412193497088	@ComfortWeight @ClumsyHotMess @champagnefiance @ExecutiveSlave People think that the evil vaccines are passed from mom to baby. I've seen people say like if your mom was vaccinated you could still have that in you and that's what causes autism in new babies that haven't had vaccines. It's ..... abhorrent	0
1122986856747024385	@localhoodgypsyy @missbethanymae I get that 100% but autism isn’t a death sentence, diseases can be and are usually fatal in children. In the case that you do end up with an autistic child, there’s plenty of things that can be done to help them prosper and live as normal a life as possible. You get me?	0
1126873821682831361	@bethanyrae__ This kid in MIDDLE SCHOOL told me he didn’t want to sit by me because I was from the Rez and had lice. So I scratched my head and touched his hand. He had OCD and autism so he started crying and put hand sanitizer. 🙃😂 I still don’t feel bad for making that bitch cry.	0
1303686831670730752	@hayisforbb @MJacksonFae @taylor_gundry @jacobccfisher Therapists do, in these circumstances absolutely.
