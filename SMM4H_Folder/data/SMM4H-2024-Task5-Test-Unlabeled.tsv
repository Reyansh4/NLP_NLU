1321605464644296705	@al_c0h0lic Apparently it wasn’t about politics at all. Someone said one of the Trump guys called the woman’s autistic son retarded and said that she should’ve aborted him. That’s what I read in the comments anyway idk

1255492562741272579	@dulsel14 @GardaTraffic Excuse me story given here? I would think the guards are needed more elsewhere and will not go to four different shops to get food as my son has autism and food aversion only eats selective things! Also I doubt the garda would bring me to my annetnal apps and sit and wait for me?

1298666923580895233	@Jahn__ @junker_jo We believe our child has ADHD too. Our schools reopened, but we kept him home. I wasn’t about this remote learning stuff. All children are different and we didn’t think he’d succeed with it. Instead, he’s homeschooled so that he can learn at his own pace.
1489857344007598082	i also get why because a lot of “autism behaviors” in young children can also very easily be just average toddler phases but i. do not know. not a single person has been helpful re: supporting his needs &gt;:(

1283174773992742913	@GeniaGlover @Jodiscohen You are literally defending the violating the probation. Someone who is suffering from ADHD and not getting the help they need to adjust should not be a violation. This child needed help and our system failed her. Instead of giving extra help and understanding they wrote it as
1433082458942099466	I literally walked up to the kid and asked how old he was and he answered 8 and I told him this is an area for 4 years and under and off he went. His dad comes up to me and tells me he has autism like that's a valid excuse to not tell this clearly coherent child right from wrong.
1126985676983914496	@NeuroRebel I was told to not talk about my son's autism in front of him. That he would make it his identity. My son is 8 years old. He is very self aware. He knows he has autism. We talked openly about it because we didn't want him to feel ashamed, like mom and dad did growing up disabled.
1171912480592785408	@MamaOfTruth @rhawk301 Same here, we've been very blessed to not have too severe of reactions frkm previously vaccinating.

1415366106924167170	So I suppose the point of this thread is that not all people with adhd and autism are the same especially girls and especially when they’re co-morbid and there has never been more of a need for teachers and others in schools to have a better understanding of both conditions.
1453880049560690690	@BxtchImAMother It definitely is/can be a ‘normal’ thing in child development. But it also could be a sign for either of those things, I’m not super educated on OCD but I know there’s a lot of other signs that they’d display. Same with being autistic, there’s other signs besides just this.

1386723397133086720	The stereotype that #ADHD is a made-up disorder for affluent white kids looking to get ahead is a big part of why poor people/women/BIPoC go undiagnosed, get misdiagnosed, or cannot access ADHD medications even with an official diagnosis.

1386597017221156866	If you have an autistic kid this is almost entirely backward. I pay no attention and make no comment when my kid eats broccoli because doing so will definitely make him stop eating it.
1419411914677968902	@plscallmeky I agree with you on this. I wouldn’t want an autistic child to grow up with a family that doesn’t want them. A child with disabilities should be loved extra hard, not resented.

1158096236974673920	As a mom to autistic sons it is amazing when other parents educate their neurotypical kids on autism so that these kids understand how to play with my boys. Right now my kids are literally just stimming with friends because their friends know they need that break ❤️
1281684104514166786	@WomenInAutism @lilririah There is this idea that I see over and over where parents struggling to parent their autistic kids is seen as.... parents struggling AGAINST their kids autism. And if they only accepted and embraced their autistic children they wouldn’t have a problem.

994448806543425536	@mamalutotwo I’m not saying vaccine injury isn’t real. It is. And it’s scary which is why i delay my childrens’ vaccinations. But i don’t believe it causes autism. My sister has autism and has never had a vaccine in her life. And this is just a show, called private practice.
1379269304814723076	I wasn’t diagnosed as “Autistic” as a child but my parents - all of them, bio and step... were on a constant quest to FIX all of us kids.   I struggled to make decisions? Put 8 y/o Elise in charge of meal planning.
1083917116879716352	But my opinion still stands that the fact that having an autistic child is so horrifying to an Anti-Vaxxer, that they would rather have a child die or suffer from an easily preventable disease, is screwed up to me.

1481542893097689091	The woman who filed a false report did so BC of a few reasons. 1) she abandoned her own son when he was 15- he is ND w/ ASD diagnosis. Instead of being there for him. 2) she abused her anxiety meds- I take the same kind but a larger dose (this matters) z(2/?)

987432739107418113	I get the feeling Paris Gellar as a character (Gilmore Girls) is a really insensitive approach at a female character with autism. Or am I missing something? Are women just neurotic rather than autistic because her characteristics are that of an autistic woman for sure?

1029995292215504897	Espicially if you have someone in your family already that’s vaccine injured   So for example, autism. It’s on both sides mine &amp; my bfs. So my son could most likely become injured due to these poison they call vaccines.

1392796226832244738	@plscallmeky Have you seen the show Atypical on Netflix? I’m curious your thoughts - a handful of friends who are child psychologists say it’s a decent depiction of autism in a teenager, but I’d love to hear your take on it.
1005432223900856321	@skywyld I was going to say people wouldn't stop their children wearing safety belts because they might cause autism but people only started using booster seats here once it became a legal requirement, so who even knows at this point?
1307419690776625155	@LMK1308 @ritson_jane @llewelyn20 I wish everyone was like you. I have my 2yo home with me but he wants to go back to nursery. He has severe asthma - hospitalised for several days each time he's had a common cold even. I am so scared and partly it's because I have to trust complete strangers to do the right thing
1451680919849512975	He’s autistic and has adhd and she’s basically refusing medical help but can’t understand why he’s having behavioral issues. I’m so worried for that baby 😭 https://t.co/eCnUWeimpS
1437446674775937030	@autumnblooms3 this girl I deleted on FB always talks about how her son is autistic but also posts he gets his “ass whooped because he knows better” and he’s literally younger than my daughter, she’s 19 months. It’s so gross.

1413725297493618688	I remember an antivaxxer acquaintance told me not to vaccinate my son because he will get autism and kids are too young to get vaccines so I said ok you get vaccinated to protect him then then I won’t vaccinate him and she said “no”. Don’t even believe in their own shit
1112147827977846786	Honestly I feel overwhelmed every day of my life. With ADHD and being Autistic, working full time with toddlers (with colleagues who oppose women’s and LGBTQ+ rights), with a toddler of my own to care for, a house to keep clean and striving to be a decent wife. It’s so exhausting

1417525812211949570	@aubrey_huff Yeah. Gotta keep cashing the alimony for a while. My 2 y/o was just diagnosed with autism. Not quite sure yet what kind of therapies that’s going to entail yet, so I can’t get a job until then. 🤷🏼‍♀️There’s always exceptions to rules….
1154308908602683392	@dancingkelsey And I don’t think that ADHD is a dirty word and I do believe that people have it. My problem is with post that simplifies it in to things that everyone goes through and how early we diagnose it in children.
1378828460085350406	My son has always been the most resilient. He would fall over as a toddler and just get back up, would ignore his illnesses even when he was suffering badly til they became life threatening (not so great). Imagine that it was ADHD making him that way. It has it's bonuses 😭

None of the rest of my autistic family do rocking (though I love rocking chairs), so it's not an everyone thing, but I think it is quite common.

1313694637463236608	@butz4bex Have you looked into how it affects women vs. the stereotypical symptoms that usually affect boys? I was diagnosed back in June and we're pretty sure a lot of my anxiety and depression is 30 odd years of untreated ADHD.

1220334542000730112	I think back then most people were anti vaccines because of religion. The whole “vaccines cause autism and Alzheimer’s in babies!” thing didn’t start until that doctor published his falsified research in 1998. https://t.co/W5j3Dhx0Jw

1325059094684848129	@BBCNews I believe a lot of children are told they have ADHD when they don't, it's just the parents not disciplining. Some would say this is smacking, some would say naughty step. I don't think parents should be scared to discipline their children. And I think a ban will do that.
1093590468984795136	A parent would like prayer for themselves and their son. They’re praying that they will be reconsidered to receive SSI benefits. The son has autism and daily therapy, so the parent cannot work. They need a financial breakthrough.

1072888833254060032	@Remeshia__ And I’ve also read on there been a measles outbreak because ppl are not vaccinating their children. Now I’ve heard about the autism and ADHD thing, where’s the statistics for that? I’m still not convinced that the cons outweigh the pros for vaccinating your child.
1250515110965268486	So this one girl I know, her 2 year old suffers from asthma, and almost everyday she takes her out. Bruh. Her daughter is hospitalized at least once a month for allergies. Does she not care? Look at these numbers. It scared me that she does. https://t.co/EJUfPmLeJJ
1383546335068966914	@ganjanodrama Not to mention there’s literally a suffocation risk. And 1 in 36 children are autistic now. Usually the more severe of that being in younger toddlers. I know I could never get winston to wear a mask if they did a mandate here. This is ridiculous.

1270638796091076608	@GiftBetterUK @PlayStation @Xbox @NetflixUK @LoveWilko I have 3 children 2 of them have asthma, so we have been, baking, costal walks, board games, camping in the house, painting for NHS, crabbing, picnics, teaparty, helping at a pantry 😊 would love to win for my children they have been so good #Giftbetter https://t.co/0feiqhFhdp
1453043884481712137	I normally don’t get on here and shame mothers for anything. But abusing a child for their behaviors that are out of their control (on the spectrum/ ADHD) is insane and then display your actions on Tik Tok…idk
1333454120712359936	"Fuck ABA. I tell all my sons' teachers that they are ""allowed"" to stim because they are autistic/neurodiverse. Why do I or anyone else get to decide they should be less of themselves? https://t.co/1mBds4BRMg"

People SO intensely, passionately, dislike the idea of having a child w/ autism they're willing to sacrifice the lives of others in the name of it.   We must confront hate we can't stop it by pretending it isn't. https://t.co/A6dxuhvU6U
1040532945520545792	#Autism doesn't discriminate it affects everyone and people of colour deserve their voices heard.

1391591477718003713	@shiraisinspired Yessss! As if it's something you can just turn on and off and choose not to turn on. It wasn't until my kid had a major speech delay and I had to brute force myself to be quiet that I was able to for his sake. (I literally didn't know how before.) And it is so exhausting still.

1112504384678555648	So if you're a parent with an Autistic child, I'd be really mindful of remembering that the Autistic adults you engage with on social media were once Autistic children, and while it might hurt when they say some things, you need to listen, to take it on board.

(Actual dad not in picture ) i explained it will be different not less and can still be inspired #DoctorWho
1213741124935802880	@brookewinters33 @jlms_qkw Agree with ALL of this and as a parent of an autistic (maybe? Certainly amazing just as he is whatever label he ends up with!!) kid it is DEFINITELY beneficial to my family to find adult autistic voices for sources of advice and information.
1185660841535987719	@RickyChamp1 And could u say a massive hello to my 2 children Callum who has autism and Kourtney who is 7 they are also big fans of urs xx
1303152948172787712	@1devilishgrin I’ve got three kids and all three have adhd and two are autistic. If my kids would have done this at that age, the activity would be done, period. I wouldn’t have filmed it and I certainly wouldn’t have shared it. Because it was shared I suspect the parents think it’s cute 😞
1454507794141437957	Women aren't suddenly getting overdiagnosed with ADHD &amp; autism. Women were drastically underdiagnosed with ADHD &amp; autism for decades, and now we can communicate with each other on the internet, gather research, &amp; fight for the diagnosis we should've received as children
1330329220401287170	@cyreejarelle I’m sad that a lot of the mainstream coverage (not the pieces by autistic people thus far obviously) barely mentions autism speaks at all— or the fact that no artist should be using videos of children’s panic attacks/abuse as “research.” It’s very hyper focused on the casting
1428722486649233414	@jmurffff I could write an anthology... But it's all the antivaxx talking points about vaccine injury and autism. She faked a religious exemption to keep her boys from being vaxxed for school, to the detriment of meeting my newborn daughter. Point is, I feel you. And I'm done with her.
1047920651485544448	Children’s immune systems amaze me. My kid sneezes once, takes a long nap &amp; is back to normal in &gt;6hrs. I catch his sickness- 102°fever, fluid in lungs, 8 different RX medications, an asthma attack every hour. Lol I’m just sitting here asking him “how did you survive this!?”
1172342277269786624	My four-year-old autistic son is afraid to go to pre-school. He claims his teacher is hitting him. I'm not sure what to do next. https://t.co/qlOAxfiQzI
1437490309009747975	Once I found a YouTube series by the parents of a nonspeaking autistic teenager. She was clearly communicating what she wanted but they were making her do performative sign language, ignoring her request and controlling her body.  I vowed never to let anyone do that to my kids. https://t.co/Bel5NA6aNr
1301509653398876160	@notcapnamerica My 5.5 yr old son is autistic and they want him to either resume in person next week (um, fuck no) or do zoom. It doesn’t work. He does well in person but he just wants to play on the computer.  Thankfully we live in the Bay Area and the district isn’t trying any shit with us.

1280905897632387072	@__notJasx I'm grateful that my son who's always been nonverbal and might also have hearing issues is progressing and trying to talk more. It makes my heart truly happy, we've put in so much hard work to help him and its finally paying off 💕 my venmo is @Regan-Carney

986992880601501696	Looking for jobs on this island to support Autistic children and I’m always asked if I’m a behaviour technician and experienced in ABA.  Well, no. Autism isn’t a ‘behaviour disorder’ and it shouldn’t be treated as such. I refuse to comply to your sick need for their compliance.
1268293509041266689	@AngryBlackLady I tell this to my white kids even. They are the last people you ask for help if you get lost. Since my boys are autistic I’m very clear, cops are never your friend. All you say is you want your mom/dad/lawyer. Period.

1065029619886186497	@OohhhJaay_ The fact u called them slow made me a lil mad but I get what your saying yea it’s getting worse as time goes on mainly with autism and that’s the scariest one because they claim to have no clue where it comes from you don’t know before hand if your child will have it or anything

1423206128939413504	@ztkelly @VikiLovesFACS Thank you. Yes I agree. And twisting time manipulate people. But still some of the information seems potentially believable. It’s more long term damage I’m concerned about for unborn baby. Developmental issues, autism etc.
1162472051514519553	My daughter is autistic and verbally she's behind her peers so if she's trying to tell me something I need her to be as clear as possible

1349061413189410819	@EarlofLeuven @JtSmith74 @victortebbit @Kathbum What I'm worried about is fussy children. Not spoilt ones, but children who are autistic for instance and they categorically will not eat certain foods. Their parents won't manage with being given random foods to feed those kids.
1360346226370039811	@BeckiShort @tashakaminsky That is really kind of you! I have long suspected I’ve had undiagnosed ADHD since I was a kid, and it’s really helpful to have you say you’ve had similar symptoms. I’d love some links to some of the ADHD accounts you follow :)

1437070675974447105	@AlisonH76825183 @thinkingautism And that didn’t make you stop to think whether maybe the dysphoria was a manifestation of the tendency towards concrete thinking that comes with autism? E.g. I like girly things, therefore I’m a girl.

1382732365827559425	@bridget_fox00 okay so, something we do for kids with autism that deal with skin picking is that we give them some glue (like the school glue) and smear a layer on their skin and to pick that once it dries. it gives the same feeling but no harm done :)
1268489823800745984	@sabzcobos No. Yes. And I was sending him to Montessori. He can't do speech therapy online.. He's 2 &amp; a half.. He's very behind.

1405172061987913735	@BertDalziel I must be a heartless btch because these things do not bother me.

1285353801310859264	@epballou I think it would be weird to use different words for disabled and non-disabled kids. And “kiddo” is a normal word to refer to kids whether they’re disabled or not.

So this is a double insult, because anti-vaxxers are basically saying they’d rather risk death than have a child like mine.

1219160841221656577	@AxelSavage4 Autism is a genetic condition, meaning the child has autism present before inoculation. I’m also going to say this: correlation is not causation, and almost ALL children are vaccinated. Before modern medicine most cases of autism were not able to be diagnosed.
1351672316292444164	@Omega3Riker Yeah again, I agree, in an ideal world. But do I sit looking at my phone all day? Absolutely. It’s my only social interaction outside of a non-verbal child, and it’s what I enjoy whilst he plays independently.

1295177269808377857	@littlemrskinder I had asthma as a child so it was diagnosed really young, but it became less serious the older I got. I think they can usually tell if you may have it by listening to your lungs with a stethoscope? Then you could just get a prescription for Albuterol

Every autistic child has different needs and there are some amazing therapies out there.

They are mourning there hopes and dreams for their child without any basis in reality. As an autistic person and former caseworker we called this martyr parenting. People can thrive beyond that pattern the parents set in their minds.
1444505422677823488	Kinda fucked that I only started clawing my way up to some minor gains, some actual progress, once I figured out the ADHD &amp; autism. Getting that piece, having context for why I'm like this, allowed me to figure out strategies to deal w it. Imagine if I got this help as a kid...

1069090202243731456	And it...explains so so much that Im almost in an existential crisis type of mind shutdown. Like, Ive never thought about autism symptoms as relating to myself - its always been other people, mainly children. So I never really had it click in my brain.

1347923573843877889	One TikTok a few weeks ago people were going after someone I follow arguing that if you have a mwntal illness (depression, anxiety, adhd, etc) you shouldn't have children. Because 1. You could pass those genetics down and 2. It may affect your parenting.
1349102148714262528	@L_D_Washington As a school psychologist I have worried about this every day! My kids with anxiety, ADHD, and struggle with being bullied so NOT want to come back. Many have great grades now. The removal of social stressors allows them to focus. Not all of course. But many.

1383380647863980037	@MamaaSofia It’s not the same but I’m pretty sure my son has adhd and I’m also not ok. I’m combined, but more towards inattentive and I’m sure he’s the hyperactive one and it’s non stop chaos with him.
1336803394019872773	My 13-year old son (he’s on the autism spectrum) hasn’t let out of his sight the past couple weeks. He wants to be in whatever room I’m in. I asked him why he has been following me around the house so much and he said, “because you’re my best friend.” Whew. Made me tear up.

1440402830456614915	@BooksandChokers I read A Kind of Spark a few weeks ago and loved it. I've been recommending it to so many people since then. Such brilliant characters and it's given me loads of things to ask myself when I'm working with autistic children. Thanks for writing it.

1307833958692827137	I'm going to say something controversial-yet-brave: ADHD doesn't exist outside a work and productivity schema. It only matters when you have shit you really need to do and can't manage to do it.   So stop diagnosing toddlers with it unless your toddler is balancing your checkbook
1403522348695920643	@HseThistleRose @pissgheti @Notwoke7 @newsmax I wonder if Moderna is a better choice for teens.  My son is 14 now.   He's very high risk because of severe asthma so he can't afford to get COVID.    I'll talk to my pediatrician like we all should.

1166441500265394176	@David_Logan2020 Up until now I didn't have the confidence to talk to new ppl and body language hand gestures was the only way I could communicatate with my son who has autism spectrum disorder and at 5 years old he couldn't even put a sentence together but I could have a conversation with him
1303685389987741698	@cottoncandyarts @entnoot My son's drs don't believe he has ADHD, since he's also autistic.   His teacher, on the other hand, believes he does indeed have it ALONG with autism.   Drs are shit. Hell, I told them that I believed he was autistic for YEARS. They said it was normal behavior.
1272639178908581888	This is utterly devastating. This poor boy, now a man. I feel so much for him, but also his mother.

1074708582514360321	@NyleDiMarco @eveewing Pretty much why I can't watch anything with a character who is on the autism spectrum. I'm not on the spectrum but my kids are and some of the stuff out there is infuriating.

1491034677372600338	This is devastating - and what I’m seeing in my almost 4 year old with speech delays.

1292072602094182405	@MimiMerlot Absolutely!!! You've got to take care of you first and foremost. I also have asthma, and that, combined with a toddler who doesn't get social distancing yet, and flat out just not wanting to discover which family members take the health of others for granted, made it a no go.

1415105990228287491	And it’s easier to blame the social differences of society. But we need accommodations and support as well as acceptance.   And autistic kids often need specific accommodations and support and therapy and teaching just to help them deal with the stresses of their neurology.

1216672339288522753	@bethanyshondark As others have said,  I think if you have no first hand experience dealing with an autistic child, better to steer clear of labeling it a non tragedy. I have seen it tear families apart - truly heartbreaking.
1029369474057691136	@britleighs1 My son's autistic and ADHD. His talking never stops. It drains me. But If I were to threaten him to stop when it's overwhelming me, that's only harming him. I instead redirect him into another topic instead of asking him to stop talking.

1297771764148080640	@3TrackMind79 I disagree that the “mourning” part is what is bad about people being sad their kid is autistic. The bad part was that they set up all these expectations of who and what their kid would be. Once they’ve done that it is absolutely appropriate to mourn and move on from that.
1326165751506595846	Another area of #parenting so different for #nonspeaking #autistic kids: conflict resolution.  Can’t tell them to use their words. Can’t ask them how they’re feeling. We can only guess at their emotions based on body language, which may be wrong. #nonverbal #autism

1372182363480883206	@TheQueenVic94 Also seems unfair to the brother, no? Some kids care about clothing, some kids don't. I'm not sure why that's even important. Some kids like making a mess, some don't. Some kids might be slightly on the autism spectrum or have sensory preferences. So?

1356399716423102465	I have the added element of Neurodiversity. His mom and her husband sometimes take lack of acknowledging name and lack of eye contact (attention) offensive like the girls don’t like them. Explaining autism and consent gets difficult with that

It's unspeakable fear and anger feeling like no how much you try to do to protect them, you may still not be able to save them.    My school age kids both have pretty severe ADHD too.

976543436684832768	You probably see a lot of people arguing if vaccines cause autism. Honestly I don’t care at all about autism. I care about my kid not waking up one morning. I care about my kid being paralyzed. I care about if she has a life long injury.
1468717721181380615	@_ericamdoyle After my daughter was diagnosed I often wondered if I was. However, the more I learned the more I realized I 100% have ADHD.   A lot of girls and women go undiagnosed with autism and/or ADHD.  It’s never too late to get evaluated. 💕

1275181174965575680	Do any other toddlers “play” like this? I’m trying to figure out if I’m over analyzing her behaviors or if they might actually be early signs of autism 🤔  And yes that’s an old tampon wrapper. I have no idea where she got it bc I don’t even use them so don’t come for me 😂 https://t.co/RSGNt4Kdjq
1276183987464142849	@Owl_Curry @such_hockey_wow @AITA_reddit Allow me to clarify, I’m not trying to diagnose anyone. I’m sorry. However, I do have experience with working with people with ASD who specifically struggled with the sensory experience of showering, and this child has some similarities based on the limited narrative provided.

1440423116719607816	Actually I have read more about the “intervention makes babies seem less autistic” study and i think it’s another marble-burying situation where the actual result is “… because they’re less stressed and we only recognise autism when it’s combined with trauma”

1215459683982426113	@lilririah @theAspergianCom If - as it seems to me - autistic children have less of an ability to regulate themselves... I can’t see that conditioning them to present a palatable set of behaviours when stressed - and avoiding stimming or meltdown - aids in teaching them to regulate or process - just ignore

He had it aged 1. I'd push for it.  It's a medical reason if she won't accept an injection and she's high risk due to asthma

I also don't trust the govt to put down any safety measures, and my kids likely have asthma (too young to be diagnosed), so we'll do what we can on our side.
1181824983493959680	I personally hate to use the word “disorder” but Autism is a serious developmental disorder which impacts the nervous system and a child’s ability to communicate and interact.
1014480174757371910	@Josephine_KK @GroundSensor @YourAnonNews Yeah because I’d rather have a dead child than an automatic one. Plus. It’s not like the link between vaccines and autism has been CONSISTENTLY disproven. Please. Get off your troll account and do some research.
1484531900857389059	So. Did you know you can't become a foster parent if you're autistic? Do you know how often the children of autistic parents are taken away (for no good reason too)? I'm often told how good a mother I am. My kids are everything. Y'all got me fucked up today. They hate us.

1125434459392811009	@slurrysoslurry The class sizing is iffy for me simply because the sizing he is upping it to is the exact same as when I was in school. The ASD funding needs to be sorted because a lot of parents rely on it to help their children.

Many Autistic adults have SOME rights, children literally have none.

1122931173607583744	I feel like so many of us just need assistance through one another.   So why don't autistics and those with special needs team up more often? An app that lets those with special needs assist one another?  Same for parents. Team up kids who work better together.  Seems obvious.
1039894503866425344	@slcobbe I found out I was autistic through my son, who then helped us to see their father is, and 2 of his sisters, which they inherited from their father. No diagnosis for my parents, but I suspect my father is. So yeah, diagnosis mostly began with the more obvious cases.

1265969512718888964	@paigeofourlives I don’t think it’s reasonable at all. Any one of their kids could have been born with Autism. Not only that, when you sign up to adopt, you’re agreeing to take in the child as is, their actions are gross af plus they abused him with duct tape so, I’m gonna disagree.
1437780521245892610	@mvpAbdi @gloriawrightt @indigogloves So yes - she goes to work every day and abuses autistic kids.   60-80% of her patients will have PTSD.   how many people does someone have yo knowingly give PTSD via conversion therapy tactics before I can call a spade a spade in a way that makes you comfy ?
1358098884820488192	@emzorbit Absolutely, and we know that they target Autistic kids and kids with depression, too.
1413650479444287490	@DogOfHeliopolis @baffled_hacker When my daughter was first diagnosed I had too many people tell me they were “sorry”.

1344409015867109377	@Lawrence Thank you for pointing this out. Too often kids are punished simply bc they don’t do well w/ testing. This doesn’t accurately reflec their intelligence. My son, who has aspergers, is brilliant but doesn’t do well w/ testing. The same goes for many kids.

1413318490178662403	I think it should be talked about more often that a speech delay doesn’t always equal special needs, autism or any other diagnosis you can give a child. Sometimes it’s just that- a delay. There’s nothing wrong with having ANY of that though. Let children just be.

My 3.5 year old has a severe language delay and sees a speech therapist who wears a mask. Not even a see through one and if we go into lockdown again all the sessions will be over a video call 🙄 x
1308018436845580288	"@FestiGal77 @KrisandJoeShow I was one of ""those"" Autistic kids. Autism isn't always easy for sure. For me, it's inherently a disability. But it's who I am &amp; I've grown to love myself. Growing up with a message that who I am isn't &amp; never will be good enough was 100% the most damaging &amp; traumatizing thing."
1031715981402419200	@DevonESawa It's been proven that vaccines are not connected to Autism. With that being said, if it was, I think I would rather have my child be alive &amp; have Autism over having my child die from Small Pox, Dysentery &amp; any other disease we get vaccined for. I mean, weigh it
1422299814759477253	@Lisa_SEND There are certainly a lot more places I would take my children in that area before I’d think to go there. My kids are 20 with LD’s &amp; autism - she wouldn’t engage at all &amp; she wouldn’t understand the whole “quiet” atmosphere there &amp; she would want to chat to every person there ..
1427662189037490179	@e_crybabby Dude ESPECIALLY if your kid has special needs or is just non-verbal, it’s like hello how about you get some training on how to react towards non-typical children before I smack you

1060742697470844928	@_KimmyBoo_ Other interventions because I have some kids in my room who are NOT ADHD but they are in meds as if they are because they got diagnosed in 2nd -4rh grade. It’s the go to diagnosis for a kid who give a teacher a headache. I don’t like that.

1217145977322266624	@TheEllenShow @RobertDowneyJr Love this so much.  My oldest child has Autism and before she finally grasped what it mean she would say it means to Be Kind To One Another. She's 12 now has a better understanding.  But when you ask her, she still says that along with explaining it in her way. ❤
1481684719372754950	@stefkaufman Right there with you. We had to temporarily pull our toddler out of daycare again (did it with delta too) bc he probably has asthma and we can’t risk it. So now we’re working from home full time &amp; watching him full time. And we’re the lucky (but stressed) ones who can accommodate

1425699789015068673	As a parent of a non speaking autistic child the last thing we want to hear is ‘oh he will grow out of it, he’ll talk when he’s ready/soon’ because that implies that being verbal is the end ‘target’ and that he’s not enough as he is - but he most definitely is, speech or not.
1277632920765767686	@color_your_lyfe Women who are autistic show so many different aspects and go undiagnosed because studies were based on white boys only. I used to watch this girl on tiktok who would educate about this! I was so shocked at how different it could be and I learned a lot

1283095772293206017	Also, if the fact that “only” a certain number of kids will die is somehow a positive to you, I want you to pick out at least one of your children’s friends you would be okay with dying. Pick a specific one. Are any of their friends diabetic or severely asthmatic? Pick that one.

He has found a great community online and loves interacting through video games. If you DM me, I can give you my son's contact info and he would be happy to reach out.

1016703240304545792	Might sound like an asshole but I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I don't see the point of 4/5 year olds being on ADHD meds. Kids are supposed to be hyper, you might need to cut down sugar, and them not listening to you is probably lack of discipline 🤗🙄

1396124808870498305	@WifeMamaHome I agree with you mostly. But speech delays don't always mean their families are neglecting to talk to them.  And advanced speech development doesn't always mean the child is being talked to more than the average. There are a lot of factors involved.
1100274950022352896	@VaniaRamirezz I talked with a therapist for years also adhd is just hyper activity it in cases causes learning disabilities some teachers don’t handle kids with adhd well so special teacher have to be put in place not saying all kids or your kid he’s young he’s probably just active I didn’t

1403180879673974788	@kierstenbrunn Not at all. My son has several medical complexities and I’ve thought this a lot. Then my youngest went into cardiac arrest at 3 months old and has developmental and speech delays. It’s so tough between all the apps and therapies. We just want normal also.

1430515107705020423	@microbiomom @VPrasadMDMPH Same. Exact. Thing. With my 2 year old. He won’t let you get anywhere close to his face with a mask. He also was just diagnosed with moderate autism &amp; isn’t talking yet, and I have wondered if masks are impeding his speech from getting better quicker.
1210965392337899526	@Alexserna26 i use it for my sons asd because it makes him feel safe and cancels out any other sensory issue he may be having. having that pressure mimics a hug and naturally causes you to feel safe and de-stress. its like swaddling but not for infants lol.
1401695896035729413	@StandingHannah I joined bc libs after fighting teachers, school boards for my son. Treated me like trash ( poor single mom who looks super young) i have report gr 1 teacher wrote for his designation (adhd) and it read like how much work SHE had to do, how hard on her, read like a comp claim
1276570737323753475	@x_m2lx @S_Betances Ok, no. We don’t need that. Research shows children w autism &amp; ADHD do better outside (literally outdoors) and not in western schools and we have our own ways of dealing w that.
1494157243368947718	Anyway, I just unfriended someone on FB who's gone pro-clownvoy, RATHER THAN point out how autistic kids like ours statistically suffer worse outcomes from Covid-19, how many fans of eugenics are down there, etc. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/thI2uwQLvc
1295641271856398338	@cartwright_xo Oh no that's really bad ... is there a chance that the kid might have autism or do you think it's down to the parent babying him?

1241130874403540992	@GovWhitmer Shelter in place! 10 days ago we had TWO cases. Today we have 549, only 36 less than Illinois who has a shelter in place order. I want to protect my older parents, my asthmatic sister, and my unborn baby.
1266505384992182273	@StandingHannah I can understand that. I have a son who is ADHD with dyspraxia and dyslexia. I understand the challenges of having a child with issues. I just think what these people did was beyond cruel.

1419650570109980677	Trying to be a parent with untreated ADHD is the hardest thing I've ever done. It's like there's a scream stuck in my throat all the time. I'm trying so hard, then I snap at my kid for making the world's most irritating whining noise &amp; I feel like a monster, which is depressing

1392325717640171520	Once I was diagnosed, I would read stories of other women diagnosed in adulthood &amp; cry. It was a massive relief to know that others felt the same way.   I wasn’t a hyperactive kid-very active but not the ADHD stereotype. I got good grades &amp; didn’t struggle much.
1194717064398815234	Ik this is petty of me but I kinda boycotted Jim Carrey when he came out as an anti-vaxxer bc Jenny McCarthy brainwashed him into thinking it caused her son to be autistic lol so the sonic movie is a no for me dog
1282823863848415232	If you ask my kids what it’s like having a mom with ADHD, I’m sure they could complain about some things. But it’s not completely without perks. For example, I regularly set the screen time timer and forget to press “start”.
1012397247932313601	I know you don't mean that. I know you would protect your kid if you understood what went down on these shows not just what you see but also what you don't see. I wouldn't let my son do it in a million years and he doesn't have autism. If he did though there would be ZERO chance. https://t.co/MajDSQ05Nb

1108068678208151554	@metteharrison Same. I don't have autism, but am super sensitive to food textures, so it really bothers me. They hopefully taught their kid how to navigate their food preferences on their own, but they shouldn't be shames for not liking sauce.

1387794781938536449	Do not do this to your kid.  I was diagnosed with a  learning disability that my mother didn't agree with and got a not very ethical doctor to say otherwise.

1089562752065114114	@AnonOpinion411 I would think if JE &amp; David refused a helmet, the doctor has the right to contact CPS and get the state involved for medical neglect. I know a girl whose son is autistic. They were in denial and wouldn’t accept it or treatment. The doctor threatened CPS. This is in Tx though.
1096807659834028039	@orangepunch1981 It's just crazy to me. It's no longer linked to autism like it was 15 years ago when my nephew was diagnosed with it. So why not vaccinate? I have read countless articles trying to come to some clue as to why??? Theres no reason! Save our kids! They are the future!!

Kind of like clothing? As if it's meant to be there naturally almost? I dunno. Just curious!

1124141242693115904	@artiKun0 @DreamNekoTV My son is autistic, and one of the most intelligent people I know. He's even in advanced classes in school. You seriously have no understanding on how much your words and actions hurt people like Neko and my family.
1412132064825118724	Might sound daft but reading @samfendermusic latest mailer gives me hope. A letter to a 17 yr old him says he was a lad from shields with ADHD whose attention was only held by music. Going through a similar diagnosis process with my son at the mo this helps as Sam is his idol.
1079190252768690176	Also something is nagging me that I remember there being some kids on the autism spectrum or with sensory disabilities that do better with hard backed strollers that are often costly. I don't know, you just never know what someone's story is.
1273620018559885317	So I’m like 99% sure Aubrey is autistic. She has a lot of the same characteristics as my younger brother and I feel like new ones pop up every week. I know it’s harder to diagnose kids prior to 24 months but I’m definitely going to mention it to her dr

1348072161479692288	@ellialicew @Ruth2729 Glad you got your diagnosis. For me I was diagnosed ASD after my son. Receiving an ADHD diagnosis too was a shock. I had spent my life wondering why others managed their achievements so easily compared to me which led to crippling anxiety and depression.

1425296631558193157	I just realized something. How can my nonspeaking autistic kids do First Reconciliation with a priest? They really will need to be able to type/point/write to get to that stage. That won't be when they're 7 or 8 years old as is customary in our parish.

1237722090461188096	@djyungsnuggie @whiteislvnd @sheikhofchic @Arabiaxo You’re playing Russian roulette by vaccinating as well. Not one parent makes the choice to do it or not do it lightly. In fact many parents do it, and watch their children change right in front of them, they form speech delays, they no longer make eye contact, they have seizures.

1250114789801463808	@boynadomama With my son, I still cry when he says certain things. He was speech delayed and I can't believe how far he's come at 6 years old. So many high fives, mama! Enjoy the high, it's so fun!
1365726342201843712	Other people said, “We don’t want to get involved in your divorce.” It’s a little scary to write a declaration that will anger a violent person, but considering he hit her because “her cry is loud and annoying,” I didn’t think their autistic toddler was safe with him.

Don’t ask me what’s “wrong” with him, there isn’t ANYTHING wrong with him. He’s exactly who he was meant to be.

Reassure her that it's not humiliating, and ask her not to take it personally. It seems she takes things quite literally.

980850883754889216	Since I'm at it, let's talk about what writers do wrong when showing characters with autism:  Stop showing how their families are suffering. What about the child's/person's POV as well? How they deal with their family's guilt? Having autism is not a death sentence!

1486822996148994052	I'll even go so far as to say comments like those are not only classist, but ableist too. What if my child were nonverbal and needed a tablet to communicate? What if I can't afford sad beige toys? Yall need to calm the shit down lol
1247474662755401728	@Tricky_1 @JimMFelton As early as you can. Most babies respond really well to sign and it can enhance their speech enormously. My toddler has ASD &amp; we use makaton so he can communicate, our 15 month old uses basic signs with him &amp; that's just from watching us use it.

1301191124820819970	My son is dyslexic and has ADHD. He's been tested and we found last year that he had trouble with phonemic awareness. I've always taken an active approach to reading with him and I don't think this is at odds with unschooling.
1033105110874746880	@KateGreen72 Yeah, that’s why I try not to judge when I see kids throwing fits or acting out in public because you never know what they’re going through. My son has a speech delay and gets frustrated not being able to communicate well, so I can’t even imagine what other parents go through.

1250627417397432320	I’ve completely given up on homeschool and I’m trying really hard to not feel guilty about it. It’s just too much to try to deal with keeping an ADHD child focused while keeping two other children happy, busy and out of the way.
1167493438461243392	They said I had until the end of the school day to provide that letter. Mind you my son was giving his albuterol all throughout last school year. He has severe asthma that’s controlled by 2 inhalers(sometimes 3 inhalers) daily.
955449426947878912	@dingstweets It didn't expect it to be so much about screens, but there it is.   I also now suspect I'm a bit adhd (like my kid.) Sitting still is not something I'm great at. I'm taking up meditation again.
1136948513001136128	Having a baby has always been what I wanted. I never used to play with doll as a kid but took an interest as to how to take care an raise a human.

1269227700557877248	@msm4rsh Hi Kym, the years that have said to go back only 2 of my 4 are in these year groups, my 4yr old in reception won't understand it all so not sending him and my year 6 son has autism but also a severe heart condition so not willing to risk his health. I'm also pregnant.
1104204001170599937	In my opinion not vaccinating your child is a form of abuse/neglect. It blows my mind that parents are more worried about their children getting autism (even though no factual evidence supports that claim) but you’re okay with them dying from preventable diseases? VACCINATE!! https://t.co/8REBAtTbR2
1211946067090198529	Like, my mam was extremely shy and anxious and wasn’t the best at communicating exactly what was going on and because of shit medical professionals like this she’s dead, leaving a 6 year old autistic boy without his mammy.

1312191726618988550	@Imani_Barbarin For me it's been whe. I've suggested other Autistic kids shouldn't have to go what I've gone though, let alone getting bleached or electrocuted. Also had it wished on my kid so he can't turn out like me.
1354799634493935619	2 1/2 is fine if not potty trained. Speech delays in twins is super common (though if they're this age and not responding to basics I'd personally be a little concerned, Magnus doesn't say many words but he understands things very clearly.)
1265046703377432576	@BergolloHar As a mother with two autistic children - I am so angry.
1256738844965138432	I am terrified of Coronavirus.   I take every precaution.  The fact is, my husband has asthma.  I am just disabled enough to not be able to work.  We have an infant daughter.   If my husband dies, I have no idea what's going to happen to me or Alina.
956301705423048704	Yah know what's scarier than autism? A kid in the ICU because of chicken pox.  One day a bunch of kids are gonna get really sick and may die and someone is gonna sue a parent for failure to vaccinate their child.
1001543588247982080	I pray to God that my baby don’t end up with asthma. I don’t wish this on anyone
1324795586051268608	@MichaelShanks Unfortunately, he is the toddler that will continue it until his friends join in. Then you have 3 toddlers screaming. It's like my son's ASD meltdowns. They don't stop.
1435873897455439874	@ElectionWiz I feel like I'm homeschooling for different reasons than most.    My son has severe asthma and is at extreme risk for covid.   I want him exposed to a myriad of ideas and schools of thought.    Rural living rocks, though.
1159518921634041856	"Yesterday my son said, ""You're my best mother.""

Long story short my uncle, moms ONLY brother, stopped talking to our family about 15 years ago because we don’t even know, we assume he’s embarrassed his son has autism. When he shouldn’t be. We barely met his youngest daughter. They never come around. Never check in
1265972274340876290	@paigeofourlives I have a cousin who is severely autistic, if they were worried about this, they never should have adopted is my point. When you have your own child this is a risk, so should she have given her blood child up too if they had autism or Aspergers?
979823506056798210	#WorldAutismAwarenessDay is coming up soon, &amp; let me tell you no one actually understand how hard things can get with an autistic child, until you experience it yourself. We have good days and bad days but at the end of the day it’s all worth it💙

1317472487727300614	@ThrstleFantstic Ah I see. I get one through the nhs each year due to asthma. They aren't doing children's vaccinations at my but they are doing vulnerable people and elderly at least.

You go through and deal with it, but then something happens or you see a child of a similar age who is much more advanced than your child and it starts over again
1095014278589861888	If you're so concerned about your child being autistic that you choose not to vaccinate, putting your child/other children at risk for deadly diseases, you should NOT be a parent in the first place.

1431452494698147842	@waitingroomwomb Possibly! It’s a mixed age group though, so he’s getting interaction with older kids and activities which is why I chose it! We actually suspect he has autism, and we are trying to get him assessed, but sessions keep being cancelled due to lockdown.

1269688839016075264	@JoametteGil Yes. I called 911 when my child had a reaction to a medication that caused him to become suicidal. Instead of an ambulance, they sent cops. Who were calm but said for protocol they had to *cuff my autistic 11 year old* and drive him to the hospital in a patrol car. Never again.

1417958524718485507	@__KaraJohnson I wasn't. Worry is that exposure may have affected staff, and that we visited within the serial interval/incubation… with a 4 year old autistic boy who touched EVERYTHING and crawled/rolled around all over the floor. Which often results in us getting sick normally.
1458857655812902914	@llewelyn20 Oh dear. I just cried at that. It’s been that kind of lovely day. A little girl in my class (4yo) helped a little boy who has autism and rarely speaks; she physically helped him wash his hands then took him to dinner chair, b4 joining back of queue to do own hands again.

1269339450166906881	@anne_theriault Yeah. I refuse to get help for anything mental health wise, no matter how bad it gets, because of my experiences as a kid. Literally nothing, for me personally as an Autistic person, could be worse than the possibility of being locked up again.

He will run away covering his ears, crying. My 6 yr old is the same (&amp; nonverbal). https://t.co/sfhqTxde2s
1114266293266526209	I just heard a caller on the radio say that vaccines are causing children to have ADHD and now I want to fight!    How did y’all get this dumb???
1325862575683362817	Constantly worry about my 5 year old making friends (since he has a language delay) ...love notes like this ❤️ https://t.co/9uqoF9Mn24
1337110817708232712	Part of this is after becoming a mom, I found it really hard to juggle baby stuff and me stuff. Also I have an adhd wired brain so I often start something only to never finish it.
1418390904273002496	My son has Autism and and we're dogsitting for a friend. I've never felt so much overwhelming joy than I have hearing him laugh. I think it's time to get a dog. https://t.co/I0sWJCRY8i IFTTT, reddit
1445851382087487489	@SSAABBBRRRAAA That my autistic child ‘needs to be disciplined’ or else he won’t be able to ‘grow out of it’,  what a joke. Haha
1221932190516350976	@confusedophan My husband and son have ADHD, so  I've become a master list maker. I'm working on other organization that can help them, but it's hard to find things that'll really work.   What works best for you to act as reminders and motivators?
1338698868523982854	There’s this little autistic boy on tik tok stimming to Megan the stallion’s B.I.T.C.H. and it’s probably my favorite video of the year so far 🥺😭
1043784512491200512	So it seems the children are getting better, well certainly no worse anyway. Whilst I seem to be getting worse, think I've inhaled all their germs! 🤧🤒  #ParentingJoys #pregnant #asthmatic and #poorly #HappySunday
1487265551709786115	@natsechobbyist It stays the same and gets worse. I’ve got two autistic kids and we need a home where they will be supported as adults. I don’t know if we can stay here and fight in our county for change anymore
986700118177923073	I used to think asthma was just about not running too fast or not playing sports. I had a few issues with it as a kid but none that were so memorable or close to my son.
1354148641741680648	I was wondering if the isolation of the #pandemic was affecting my 3 y/o:  A couple weeks ago after his in-person autism assessment, he cried when we got home.  Today, after his annual pediatric check-up, he cried when we got home.  Like all of us, the kids want out! #KidLife
1122906782198792192	@Chalks44 Have you not seen the devastating effects of measles and polio etc..??? And even if vaccines did cause autism ( which they DON’T) I would much rather my child be “autistic” then have measles or polio 🤷🏻‍♀️

1424319579430477827	Is there any point in trying to teach my autistic kid how to label the full range of NT emotions?  I feel like not only do I not recognise them, I don't feel them. I can probably separate them into 6 emotions at a push. 50 seems extreme.   * read disclaimer

1345901359602814978	Will be WFH full-time with 2 young children in ‘synchronous’ home schooling this week. Not sure our internet or ADHD 6-year-old can handle so many long simultaneous Zoom calls. I imagine it will be even more of a nightmare for teachers with children of their own.

1426224094689697792	I think it’s funny when people say “mild autism”. Like as if to justify to themselves that their child isn’t “severe”. But also, how does one have a disability mildly? So they have medium and spicy autism? Barbecue ? Get out of here. Your child is autistic. Period.

1273323908389842946	I absolutely hate Tick Toc with a passion and nobody will change my mind on that. It’s toxic af and quite frankly it’s full of some of the worst thing or society has to offer. The only one I like is that girl talking about her autism.
1191894383618068482	Grayson is almost done with this autism study and I am seriously going to miss the team - especially Stacey. She has been amazing for our family, how do you adjust without their help after having it for a year? 😩 being a mom to a child with autism is not easy, but so rewarding.
1453282943862988807	@SianChristinaK oh I feel the same even tho I also know I shouldn’t. I’m finding it extremely hard to not get frustrated with my son who has adhd 😭 like I remind myself every day times are tough but also why do I suck at this lmao

1427419193524248579	When I was being interviewed for a podcast today, I was asked what I like about having ADHD.  My response? It makes me a fun mom. I'm ALWAYS down to be goofy and learn super random fun facts with my son.  What's your favorite part about being neurodivergent?
1443174194188111873	I don't think I'll ever get an autism diagnosis. I spent 8 years in theatre as a kid, watching TV for endless hours, acting out all the responses I saw until they were second nature, even though they were unnatural to me. I can look someone in the eyes (until I'm in distress).

1468375119307239425	having an autistic child is not something to be disappointed about. this is disgusting. if my baby BOY OR GIRL was born autistic i would not be disappointed or treat them any differently (besides helping them in ways they need extra help).
1449023374332674051	So many parents are afraid of “othering” their child but Jesus Christ. Early intervention is free and key. The ‘wait and see’ approach leads to literacy and language delays later in life. EI changed our lives in so many ways.
1111628181650444288	@RBalli_ And dont blame her she has been brainwashed by society. I believe parents of autistic children need counseling themselves to understand and process - they can’t just snap out of it
1151120687072890880	@TEE1031 i know canada has good programs. but, yeah, reality is wherever we’d run to there would be a serious lack of network, which as a parent, especially of asd child, is very important. i keep thinking i’m irrational about wanting to run, but i really want to run. seek asylum up North

1275027032112615425	@thatoneginger16 Girl same 100% I always ignored my dad when he told me the high chance of me having adhd, but recently I’ve gotten to a point where I can’t ignore it anymore, and it all makes so much sense for me it’s crazy 😩
1247319514599034892	@FederalAgentMom Ah I'm just railing on everyone here saying life should be perfect with the kids and if it's not there's something wrong with the mom. Some winners today went to town on a mom of an autistic kid. Really soured the day for me. Made me ill seeing how nasty this side of twitter is.
1018194174552649728	This mom just claimed that now vaccines cause SIDS and that she’d rather her kids have measles than autism IF THEY DID CAUSE AUTISM, bc measles “isn’t that scary” I’m done with the internet for today

1434185384045465601	Every so often I search Pinterest for age-appropriate science or art projects to do with my autistic kids. Then I reject most everything I find.  We can't expect our kids to talk, read, write, draw, color, or use fine motor skills.  We can pour, mix, paint, glue, stick, and poke.

1190415047601901570	@soundcube I definitely understand where you are coming from, &amp; agree that Autistic adults are regularly ignored. But minors always have far fewer rights. All rights of personhood are given to the parents, not the child. Minors need the most protection, even from their own parents.

1032759731473928192	@ashtonemichael 😭 they’re just so tempting lol all I care about is that the kids have something to eat if we lose power. Skylar and I have our adhd medicine, so we won’t even be too hungry and we can just stay hydrated.
1304054406481154048	@FaithFortune99 @taylor_gundry @jacobccfisher Not every parent can deal with meltdowns. As an autistic adult there’s nothing ANYONE can do to calm me down. It’s not the mothers fault. Well done for being well versed in how to care for your child but some people need extra help and should be demonised for doing so.

1461891580680228866	@ST4RBELLE I need to agree on that. The parents are usually the source of my headache. Some of them are denials over the facts that their kids need help and medication. One of them slapped me for telling them to consult to psychologist over the fact that their kid showed signs of autism.
1100392030751080448	But there’s also no doubt in my mind that it’s been exacerbated by undiagnosed ADHD.   It presents differently in women and girls. It can manifest in shyness and withdrawal in some *as frequently as* compulsive chatter and movement does in others.
1042052035376558080	@VeraMistral The problem is that if you want a large family, you need to start young.

I say have children first, career after

1073725901781782528	I am learning a lot. I hope that one day we can stop making kids with #ADHD learn the way we want them to and instead learn the way they need to. Thank you, Andrea @runitrunnels for being an advocate for so many! https://t.co/Vks9z9pQCj
1348626412249473024	@yeralizard @mustangsart As a mother of a young autistic daughter, can you explain this to me? I feel like I’ve used both phrases but she’s only 4 so she can’t tell me what she prefers. Id love to understand &amp; not be using the wrong terms
1181337141223161856	@taylorparsons1 My 2 year old was speech delayed, I could tell since he was about a year that he wanted to say things but just couldn't get them out. Was only saying about 3 words at 2 years old. Started speech therapy at 2, most docs won't refer you till then and seen a slight improvement he +
1067876147227054080	@nonelvispub She washes her hands so she's good (or so she says). She also thinks vaccines cause autism, although I think I've got her a little turned around on that one as I've brought her with me when my kid got her shots.

1411959720659853312	@QueenVicToriouz My son is autistic and sometimes he is held as he is a risk to himself and to others. I mean he literally would kill himself. I'm not saying this is same but I would be surprised if it wasn't.
1270520750349393925	@James78141017 My girls were that way as well. Couldn’t stay in their seats to save their lives. They both tested positive for severe ADHD. They both took meds which I was reluctant about but it changed their lives. However, they went to a wonderful elementary school. Now adults not on meds
1453979625546203136	The best thing I’ve heard this morning is my 3 year old singing Happy Birthday to my husband. It’s been a difficult year with his speech delay but we finally feel like we are turning a corner. So proud of him 🥰.
1391450926104387586	@Knighty681 Thank you. Xx My youngest son is also ASD and has lost a hand sized area of his hair through stress hes 7. Im just taking things one day at a time with the three of them at the moment.
1414677941103915008	My daughter is perfect regardless , but she has to get screened for autism . She shows enough markers , that her pediatrician thinks it’s worth getting tested for . She also has to go to ECI for some extreme separation anxiety .  Just keep us in your thoughts and prayers .❤️
427428832904491008	@pinkyprincess01 i have a mild case of ASD. I had LSA's. Hope they do the same for your son.
1347175971615633408	@alcatelmobileuk This would be amazing. My son is 9 and has high functioning autism, he finds it difficult to stay focused while learning in a home environment so I'm trying to make him a quiet space away from his 21 month old sister so he can focus more.

1207710962800889859	@HouseOf_Jezebel Same. My sister (or me) usually has to explain that my brother is autistic so they should try to include him in activities. These kids live in the same hood as my aunt and cousin so I’d assume they understand what’s going on. He’s laughter was genuine

1412588854025011201	I need help and tbh the autistic community is saying “aba is harmful” but not giving no type of alternative or support for parents that don’t have the privilege to choose other therapies. Parents that cannot help their kids with harmful/aggressive behaviors.
1434948009318666243	Ah, yes - nothing autistic girls love more than being constantly told we have a male brain. Yeah, we're the ones with social communication difficulties. https://t.co/o7tljAbiql
1316506377410564096	Mental work is a million times more exhausting than physical work. Especially for an extremely hyper adhd girl like me. I’ve done so much paperwork this month I’ve cried from how exhausting it was. Now ya know why I do cardio for a living 😂
1321850562342780928	@gills1905 @boxbreds @GAFollowers I agree slightly... it was a risk but at the same time he was only upset because of what the man called him.... thats a 16 year old baby kids are off limits period! Just bkuz he has autism doesnt mean he cant do things non autistics do i have a panic disorder but i dont let a pot
1286565796404015104	Yeah I’d thought about it. I’d thought about whether my kid might be autistic, have ADHD, have a chronic illness or disability. And thought about how each of those things might be specifically difficult for me and my family and our situation as a defence family.
1270768896216305665	I am handling so much right now. Grief, deployed husband, the level of hate people have towards me because of my career. Inherent stress of work. Taking care of my kids on my own. Pandemic with a child that has chronic asthma.  I am staying afloat but barely.
1039788260019589121	@CBeebiesHQ When my son was 5 (he has autism) I said to him “I love you” he replied “oh thank you, I wish I could say I love you but I don’t”

1398961415986335746	@PaddyMcGuinness Butlin’s is incredible for kids. My autistic son absolutely loves the place. It’s perfect for children with additional needs. Also it ticks all the boxes you’re after.

1440702584377937923	@neluunaa I read the study and as a non-autistic parent I thought perhaps better understanding baby’s communication would be helpful in general and reduce frustration for the parent. But it was a bit strange to wrap my brain around the reduction in diagnoses.

My son (7) has ADHD and he explains it like there's a bunch of noise in his head all the time and a lot of times he'll repeat the first 3 or 4 words of what he's trying to say over and over because he can't settle down enough to get the words out and then he gets frustrated

1414410999084449793	@mitdasein I’ve done the same. What if when I was a kid they’d have more knowledge and been able to actually help me? Then again, what if I’d been diagnosed with autism and had worse “treatments” than the form of behavioral therapy I got. Really hard to say, especially back then.

1119776311210315777	I’m so frustrated so I’m going to rant, here’s a thread:  I work with kids that are on the severe end of the autism spectrum. So severe that their parents sent them states away from them to get the help they need because their parents didn’t want to be afraid of them anymore.
1012232128916905984	There’s also this general refusal to just accept their autistic kids. Instead of adapting the environment, it’s “how do I stop my kid screaming when I have their hair cut” - well they’re obviously attempting to exercise bodily autonomy, so maybe DON’T CUT IT.

I’ve used it in several public situations , it’s great to know!

1266223762824806401	I’m not saying parenting an autistic kid isn’t challenging sometimes. It is. But parenting my typical child is ALSO challenging. Parenting is hard work, period. It’s just that we’ve been programmed for a typical world with typical challenges, and people are scared of non-typical

For someone who works with special needs children, it's a bit odd that you just jumped to this conclusion. As it turned out, the mother ended up stating that they aren't disabled nor autistic.

1130979801978875904	@woediesxo I can see that but as an adult that has worked with non verbal autistic children, its about your energy approaching negative behavior.

1226164203016245249	I can’t believe parents take the stance of “I’d rather my child die than get diagnosed with autism” is so bizarre!! Vaccines don’t cause Autism!! I will keep posting this until anti-vaxers disappear.
1237504829221523457	@taperoo2k I can imagine. I picked up my daughter's cold over 2 weeks ago and it's been coming and going, normally germs don't like me after 3 days they piss off from my inhospitable body but this slow cough/ear ache/sore throat really doesn't want to go. And the asthma get worse
1340123832237973505	@Briannackw @theporshaedmun @_moonsol @bIondiewasabi I thought so too but i’m making like $12.50 an hour doing accounting... and It’s applied behavioral intervention for children with autism! helps parents and children manage stimulation difficulties without yelling, hitting, etc!
1049459172767608833	Got a 5yo having asthma trouble tonight. Would appreciate it if you’d say a prayer for my sweet girl.
1086676193703849985	Jenny McCarthy writes about how parents of autistic children are warriors because obviously we are in a war with our children because we have to work differently to raise them and how we can heal and prevent autism and in this super long and profanity filled essay I will https://t.co/pUEgBuuCIx

1149863709893910529	I told her no, but explained that she understands what we are saying and she is able to make requests/demands but can’t keep up a typical conversation. All the girl asked was “how come?” So I told her that she was on the autism spectrum and she says “oh! Okay. I get it now.”
1197350969970851840	Lol I have a degree in child development and a Registered behavior technician NATIONWIDE. I’m definitely qualified and in the right career to be working with kids with autism. Glad you’re trying to use your brain to think otherwise though😘
938031047370948609	@Johanne_4 I almost didn’t write because I didn’t want to be one of those “have you tried...” He can even take a spoonful of honey and wash it down with warm water. Especially if needing a quick fix during night time. We used to do this for me when i coughed as a kid with bad asthma.
1238586194218250242	I’ve been a committed &amp; faithful Kaiser member my whole life, but this treatment they are giving my 10 month old son who is having potential asthma complications is unacceptable &amp; they will 110% be receiving a grievance from me. Got me allllll the way fucked up
1445673060183379976	Yes, an employer is obligated to let me leave in that instance, but they’re not obligated to pay me.  My mum has cancer, along with numerous other health conditions, and my sister has 3 kids of her own, one with ADHD and one with her own issues (yet to be diagnosed)

1080676825922260995	@IamKaylaBB Actually that’s not how autism works. I completely respect your opinion on Vaxxs after what you went through with your baby but it doesn’t cause it. Autism happens during pregnancy. As someone with an autistic sibling I find it offensive that people think that’s what caused it.
1144768949034344450	@momcentrl She just said special needs children shouldn’t be in public school?? My preschool class had two non-verbal special needs student, and one student who only spoke mandarin. Doesn’t mean we beat them or treat them with a lack of respect because they can’t talk. Wtf.

1113193222958923777	I can’t believe that there is actually an argument out there that consists of.  Vaccinate your kids!  No! They may get autism.  If you don’t vaccinate them they may die.  Meh I’ll take that risk.  These people should have their kids taken off them

We wish we could have had the safety and support of being told it is okay to have a meltdown, that we are safe but our fears and emotions are still valid.
