1396600601388126208	She understands nothing about my depression, ADHD, anxiety or BPD. She just sees me as a fucked up, lazy, piece of shit daughter that will never be able to do anything right.	0
1232841955484282880	@NotEdelweiss Yes fingers crossed 🤞   I’d think that daily doses of medicine would help keep the lungs clear. Last year son &amp; I each got the flu and had no asthma issues (thankfully). I think the steroid inhalers we both take daily helped us from getting very sick.	0
1108480192253591552	I’ve been blocked on twitter for saying that these parents shouldn’t have ignored their autistic 5 year old daughter while she played by a dangerous, fast flowing, high current river. She fell on rocks &amp; immediately was swept away to her death. YES IT IS THEIR GOD DAMN FAULT.	0
1068626919996952576	Of course everyone wants a healthy child without disabilities, but I would MUCH rather raise a child with autism and any other disability than to risk the chance of my child SUFFERING and DYING because of my ignorance. VACCINATE YOUR CHILDREN! https://t.co/pUUWXB7WCD	0

941777263556743168	Sometimes my job as a #musictherapy-ist is to just reassure a mother that their child is not just an autistic little monster like others make her feel like the child is.   Moms, your child is a gift; beautiful, precious and full of life. Autism or not. #thereisnonormal #autism	0
1211463170319114240	Yes. My son's ADHD symptoms began after he received the DTaP shot at 20 months. I firmly believe his neurological developmental disorder was triggered by the vaccine. https://t.co/thItG4rJyj	1

1111213383540461569	I don’t understand how anti-vaxxers are more scared of their child developing autism than of their child catching a life threatening disease.

1074744584469651459	Now, if he is autistic, it won’t bother me. I’ve worked with autistic children and my son being autistic would not bother me.  I just really, really dislike the judgemental looks from other parents, who are thankful it’s not their child whilst I’m being head butted by my son.	0
1070863189779320837	@MelissaBeagley I haven't had experience parenting a kiddo with autism, but I have worked with them, and I think the hardest thing is that everything is so counterintuitive. What you would do for a typically developing kid, just makes things worse for an autistic one.	0

1011747007659237376	Ummm I think in my opinion if ppl rly believed that, then it’s a fear of just not wanting ur child to go thru the struggle of having autism... as a mother that’s how I’d feel... granted I’m not dumb enough to believe that https://t.co/kgEA5upOep	0
1008705820098359297	VACCINATE YOUR KIDS. I almost died of pertussis as a baby thanks to anti-vaccination movements. You’re not preventing autism; you’re killing kids. Stop it. https://t.co/Gr0tJLx5hs	0
1315557564856360961	@upthetwerx By brother has been autistic since he was small child and doctors said he was just hyper active. So he was diagnosed with ADHD. My mom didn’t find out he was autistic until he was 22. Hes 24 now. It’s frustrating to say the least. She only tested him because someone mentioned it.	0
1189665662064582656	If a child is non verbal through autism a parent could simply say “they’re non verbal” rather than giving them a blue bucket and letting everyone know it’s a vulnerable child, it’s so unsafe.	0

It’s not just about her. It’s protecting the unprotected. No compassion or understanding in these people. My raising doesn’t allow that	0

1013851389963927553	An NCT friend recently put this into perspective (not that I’d ever query vaccinating my children, I had MMR ffs!) Wouldn’t you rather your child was alive and possibly autistic, than dead??? 🤦🏽‍♀️ https://t.co/xcZbwBVEtX	0
